# Mouse Movement Bug Fix Explanation

## The Issue
The error occurs in the `MockMouseController.move()` method in `mouse_hook.py`. The error message shows:

```
File "C:\Users\jplt\Desktop\RecoilSync\mouse_hook.py", line 97, in move
  ctypes.windll.user32.SetCursorPos(x.value + dx, y.value + dy)
                                    ^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'POINT' object has no attribute 'value'
```

## The Problem
The code that's running on the user's machine is trying to access a `value` attribute from objects named `x` and `y`, but these objects don't have such an attribute. 

This suggests that the running code is using variables of type `POINT` but trying to access them as if they were `c_long` variables (which do have a `value` attribute).

## The Solution
The correct implementation, which is actually already present in the workspace code, is:

```python
@staticmethod
def move(dx, dy):
    point = ctypes.wintypes.POINT()
    ctypes.windll.user32.GetCursorPos(ctypes.byref(point))
    ctypes.windll.user32.SetCursorPos(point.x + int(dx), point.y + int(dy))
```

This correctly:
1. Creates a POINT structure
2. Passes a reference to it to GetCursorPos to get the current cursor position
3. Uses the x and y attributes of the POINT structure when setting the new cursor position

## Deployment
The code in the workspace is already fixed, but it appears that this fixed version hasn't been deployed to the user's machine yet. Make sure to deploy the latest version of the code with this fix to resolve the issue.

The old code was likely using separate c_long variables for x and y coordinates instead of a single POINT structure, causing the error when switching to the POINT structure without updating all references.
